# Virtual-Orrery-and-Real-Time-Rendering

This assignment was programmed in OpenGL for the course Introduction to Computer Graphics. For all assignments in this course we were provdided by instructor Faramarz Samavati with a skeleton code that included classes for elements such as textures and shaders. My work for this assignment was only present in main.cpp file as well as fragment and vertex shaders.
The task was to create three spheres, use texture mapping to show Sun, Earth and Moon textures, and animate the spheres to have rotation and translation, both with inclination axes.
